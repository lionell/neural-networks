# C# Neural Networks Tools
The main idea is to make tools for comfortable developing neural networks. As the idea it was a C++ library. But C# is much more comfortable for developing this kind of projects. .Net contains lots of suitable data structures. 

### Project structure
* /cpp contains C++ libraries to work with neural networks
* /presentation contains materials I used to present this project
* /Neural Networks/Neural Project contains C# tools to work with nerual networks
* /Neural Networks/Neural Project/Examples contains examples of library usage
* /Neural Networks/SmartPacmans contains demo game my library

### Bonus
![Smart Pacmans](https://github.com/lionell/lionell.github.io/blob/master/images/pic03.jpg "Demo game")

A great part of project is demo game Smart Pacmans. You can enjoy neural networks + genetic algorithms. Idea is taken from [this article](http://habrahabr.ru/post/168067)
